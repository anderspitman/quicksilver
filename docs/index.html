        <h1> Quicksilver </h1>

        <h2> A 2D game framework written in pure Rust </h2>

        Quicksilver allows you to create 2D applications targeting Windows, macOS, Linux, and the Web 
        all from the same codebase, using only Rust. 

        <h4> What's included? </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 2D geometry: Vectors, Transformation matrices, Rectangles, Circles, Line segments, and a generic Shape abstraction
            <li> Keyboard and 3-button mouse support
            <li> OpenGL hardware-accelerated graphics
            <li> A variety of image formats
            <li> Sound clips and a looping music player
            <li> Asynchronous asset loading
            <li> Unified codebase across desktop and the web
        </ul>

        <h4> Supported platforms </h4>

        The engine is supported on Windows, macOS, (somewhat) Linux, and the web via WebAssembly. 
        Linux is supported inasmuch as the libraries used for 
        graphics (glutin, gl) and sound (rodio) work correctly, 
        but no extra attempts to support exotic setups will be made. 
        The web is only supported via the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` 
        Rust target, not through emscripten. It might work with 
        emscripten but this is not an ongoing guarantee.
        <br>
        It has not been tested extensively on desktop platforms 
        other than x86, but there is no reason it should fail to 
        work. If the dependencies and the Rust compiler support a 
        platform, quicksilver should as well.
        <br>
        There are no plans to support mobile / touch-primary 
        platforms, as the paradigms are completely different. UI 
        elements must be created differently, input is one or two points
        of contact rather than primarily through a keyboard, etc. 
        <br>
        There is one exception: macOS does not currently support gamepads, see <a href = "https://gitlab.com/Arvamer/gilrs/issues/3">gilrs issue #3</a>
        
        <h4> Supported Compiler Versions </h4>
        The desktop targets should always compile and run on the latest
        stable rust. 
        Currently the web target is limited to nightly rust, because 
        the WASM target that does not require emscripten is limited 
        to nightly.
